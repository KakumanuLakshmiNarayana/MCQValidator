MCQValidator
What This Project Does
MCQValidator is a tool that recognizes handwritten digits, focusing on numbers 1 to 4. It uses machine learning to learn from examples and then accurately predicts new numbers.

How It Works
Training: The train_mnist.py script teaches the program to recognize digits using example images.
Conversion: convert_to_onnx.py transforms the trained model into a format that's optimized for fast predictions.
Prediction: With predict.py, the program analyzes images of digits and guesses which numbers they are.
How to Set It Up
Download the program.
Install necessary tools like PyTorch and ONNX.
How to Use It
Start by training the model.
Then convert the model for predictions.
Finally, use the model to predict digits from images.

Future Plans
We're looking to expand its capabilities to recognize even alphabets.
